ENV SUMMARY="Platform for building and running PHP $PHP_VERSION applications" \
    DESCRIPTION="PHP $PHP_VERSION available as container is a base platform for \
building and running various PHP $PHP_VERSION applications and frameworks. \
PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make it easy for developers \
to write dynamically generated web pages. PHP also offers built-in database integration \
for several commercial and non-commercial database management systems, so writing \
a database-enabled webpage with PHP is fairly simple. The most common use of PHP coding \
is probably as a replacement for CGI scripts."
